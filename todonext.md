# TO DO SOON


### back end
- change TetrisGrid so that it only remenbers the TetrominoKind of the blocks in the matrix
    that means the render has to be modified


## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player

## Multi-player

- add the seed, etc. to settings_manager


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
