# TO DO SOON

- during the countdown, the tetromino pieces can move...
- when you quit the game, the game is still linked to the key bindings
- the countdown cannot be stopped
- when player becomes host, a convenient port number is written to the file
- erase active tetromino on restart... it can be in the middle of the screen

## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
