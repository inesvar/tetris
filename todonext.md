# TO DO SOON

- change the serialization of PlayerScreen so that the ghost tetromino is not sent

## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player

## Multi-player

- add the seed, etc. to settings_manager


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
