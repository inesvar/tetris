# TO DO SOON

- send serialized screen DURING START
- the countdown cannot be stopped
- erase active tetromino on restart... it can be in the middle of the screen

## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
