## Functionalities

- press key s open settings
- add 180Â° key
- assets load bug when too low in filesystem
- re-implement clipboard copy/paste button using arboard (https://crates.io/crates/arboard/3.4.1)

## Organization

- fix documentation errors
- provide a development container
- split project in executables and lib (for instance, back-end is just a tetris lib! maybe assets is the same way)
