# TO DO SOON


- SEPARATE local_player into different files coz that's unbelievable
- review app.rs because it's too complicated
- in keyboard, replace the hashmap to booleans by a hashset

## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player

## Multi-player

- add the seed, etc. to settings_manager


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
