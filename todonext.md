# TO DO SOON

## Tetris Guideline

- the freeze_tetromino can make you game over according to TG
    - return an Option and carefully change local_player
- the garbage can make you game over but it's extremely unprobable so we'll just ignore it !
    - return None for add_garbage

## Multi-player

- add the seed, etc. to settings_manager


# LONG-TERM
- sending garbage after T-spin

## Tetris Guideline
- rename Block -> Mino
- search for all the other stupid shit supposed to be renamed
